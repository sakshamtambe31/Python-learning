# There are various types of string operstions which can be used while we program
# the first one is the concateantion which adds two strigns together
print("hello" + "World")

# what if we add number - the answer wont be the addition it will just stick them togehter have a look in below example
print("2" + "2")

# the answer is 22 not 4 here + is not addition operator it is concatenate operator
# you can add multiple strigns together for example
print("hello " + "my " + "name " + "is " + "barry")

# what if we want to multiply a string?? lets see..
print("Apple "*5)
# here 5 multiplies apple five times thus it gets repeated as specifie times
