# To print a string we use a single quote
print('Hello World')

# but it is always suggested to use doube quote "  "
# TO avoid such kinds of error
# print('He's a good guy)
# here you will get syntax error to avoid it, you can make use of the method given below
print("He's a good boy")

# now if you want to print something in new line then we will make use of \n
print("Hello Jarvis \n i want to sleep")
