# List is a datastructure in python which allows you to store data in one place
# List is an alternative to array

# Here we will create a list of names of people
names = ["Shubham", "Barry", "Kazuto", "Mohan", "Yash", "Anuj"]

# to print the entire list we follow the below code
print(names)

# To print names according to the index number we will use the below code 
# note indexing in python starts with 0
print(names [3])
# this will print Mohan

# This can also be used to know what is stored in which place in list

# do you know you can also create an empty list
abc= []
print(abc)
